GrandOrgue allows the user to load and play virtual pipe organs.
Using sample sets, GrandOrgue is able to combine the individual pipe
sounds and organ behaviors to simulate a variety of pipe organs.

      <para>
GrandOrgue is capable of loading and faithfully reproducing a variety
of sample sets. The sample set format is described later in this
manual. The format is backward compatible to Hauptwerk&#8482; version
1 samplesets. As such, you won't be able to do anything at all with
GrandOrgue without at least one sample set. Sample sets generally come
packaged or with installers. By default, the software loads organs
from "My Organs" in your documents folder, but you may store sample
sets wherever is convenient and space permits.

Please look at https://sourceforge.net/p/ourorgan/samplesets/ for
more information.

sound and turning off all notes. It may also be quickly accessed on
the toolbar or via the <emphasis>Escape</emphasis> key on the computer keyboard. This should be generally
unnecessary, although it may be useful if you need to quickly stop the

The spinner sets the current program number. This might be termed a
"sequencer" on modern computerized organs. It is possible to store up
to 1000 organ states and access them sequentially via the predefined
MIDI events, or access any setting directly through the spinner. You
may also use the left and right keys on the computer keyboard to scroll through
the programs, and down to reactivate the current program (if you have
changed the stops since last activating it, for example). Note also
that when memory set is engaged, the target program will be stored to,
i.e. if you push Shift + Right then the program would be advanced and
the current settings would be saved to this same next program.

        <para>The polyphony control sets the maximum polyphony before GrandOrgue
will refuse to play any additional samples. To oversimplify, polyphony
is the number of pipes that may sound simultaneously; but polyphony
may also be consumed when a key is released. It is recommended to
experiment with this setting initially, but leave it once you find an
acceptable setting. Your setting should balance between too little
polyphony (where you might not be able to play many notes on large
sample sets) and too much polyphony (where the CPU will overload and
artifacts will appear in the sound). Note that "wet" sample sets
(those with considerable reverberation) will consume polyphony many
seconds after the note is actually released. The default setting of
2048 should provide a reasonable starting point on a 1GHz CPU. The polyphony monitor is displayed next to the spinner. The clip indicator at
the far right will turn red if the polyphony limit has been reached,
and will stay red until the polyphony is adjusted.

These spinners set the controller values range which defines a full open/closed
enclosure. The value is rescaled to the full range (0-127) for that controller.
Values outside the range are translated to their limit values: value&#160;&lt;&#160;lower
limit yields 0, value&#160;&gt;&#160;upper limit yields 127.

GrandOrgue supports "active" labels. These are labels which display variable
contents, such as the step number in the <!-- link
linkend="crescendoPanel"-->Crescendo panel<!--/link-->, the temperament name in
the <!-- link linkend="masterControls"-->Master Controls panel<!--/link--> and
many others. Labels can be configured only for sending data to a Midi LCD
device. GrandOrgue sends the label contents following the Hauptwerk&#8482; standards.

this option will fade out the release sample if the note is played

This will apply a very small random detuning before each pipe begins to speak.
The detuning is small enough so that the ear can't appreciate the tuning difference and large enough so that it approximates the tiny interferences (due to physical location) that occur when playing multiple real pipes in an organ.

          <para>The assertions about audio quality should be used as guidelines only. As a rule of thumb, polyphase gets better treble, linear gets better bass, and this is most noticeable in sample sets that use interpolation extensively (e.g. retuning a detuned organ).  Audio quality is highly subjective, so the user is strongly encouraged to listen for himself and retain the setting that suits him better.</para>

          <para>
If set to Mono, all samples are loaded in Mono. When compression is disabled, this will save 50%, but when compression is enabled, much less will be saved because the compression is much less effective on monoaural inputs.

This setting can be set to don't load, if you want GrandOrgue to avoid loading any samples. Via <link linkend="organsettings">Organ Settings</link>, it is still possible to load only specific parts of the organ.

Convolution reverberation uses the mathematical model of a room response to
alter an audio wave so it sounds as if it had been produced in that room. The
room response is triggered by a bang (starter pistol, balloon pop, hands clap,
...) which is closest to a pulse covering all frequencies. The room response is
made of the volume and decay of sound reflection on walls, floor, ceiling, and
the delay introduced by the room size. The bang record is fed to the
convolution engine to produce the reverberated wave.
      </para>
      <para>The reverberated wave is usually mixed with the direct dry sound to better simulate what the auditor would hear if he were in the physical room.</para>

            <simpara>
The reverberated sound, when fed alone to the audio system, usually sounds a
bit muffled and a bit garbled by the alterations introduced by the room
response (delays, multiple echos, etc.).  Adding the direct sound is the only
way to get a clear sound, so this box should be checked at all times.

              <simpara>
Set the <link linkend="releasetaillength">release tail length</link> to a low
value if you want to use the convolution reverberation alone, ie. without the
recorded release tail of wet samples.

This allows the setting of a channel offset. A channel offset allows the use of
two MIDI interfaces with conflicting MIDI channels. For example, applying a
channel offset of 8 to one of the MIDI interfaces would cause that interface's
channel 1 to appear as channel 9, channel 2 to appear as channel 10, and so on.
This may be useful if you have multiple keyboards that are configured to use
the same channel.

      <title>Tuning and Voicing frame</title>

      <para>This feature is closely related to the temperament feature which assumes, when the samples are dynamically retuned after a new temperament is applied, that pitch information was embedded in each sample file <emphasis>or in the pipe entry within the Organ Definition File</emphasis>. If the sample set designer has <emphasis role="bold">NOT</emphasis> embedded pitch information, the result is weird and unpredictable.</para>
      <para>When checked, this box instructs GrandOrgue to ignore any pitch information found is sample files while retuning the organ to another temperament than the original. This way the retuned sample set behaves as expected. In this case, GrandOrgue assumes that the samples are tuned to equal temperament.</para>

the MIDI event it is currently tied to; the "Channel" column indicates
which channel the action will listen on, if any; the "Data" column
indicates the specific data which will trigger the action - for
example, a controller number or a program change number. These actions
may be modified by selecting the action and clicking "Properties", or
by double-clicking on the action.

This displays the MIDI event editor dialog. You may select an event
from the drop-down box (only available events will be shown), or you
may select "(none)" to disable the action. The channel spinner sets
the channel tied ot the MIDI message, and the data spinner (when
applicable) selects the data tied to the MIDI message. For easy
configuration, click "Listen for Event" and then perform the desired
MIDI action (i.e. push a note on the appropriate keyboard, do a
program change, flip a MIDI switch, etc). If the performed MIDI event
is allowed for this action, its data is filled in and the "Listen for
Event" button is deactivated. You may also manually deactivate the
listener by clicking on it again. Be sure to select OK to save your
changes when you're done.

A list of all MIDI input interfaces available. Selecting a device
means that GrandOrgue will listen for incoming MIDI messages on

or loopback device.

      <para>
Either select a device and click Advanced, or double click on the
device. This brings up a window that allows the setting of a channel
offset. A channel offset allows the use of two MIDI interfaces with
conflicting MIDI channels. For example, applying a channel offset of 8
to one of the MIDI interfaces would cause that interface's channel 1
to appear as channel 9, channel 2 to appear as channel 10, and so
on. This may be useful if you have multiple keyboards that are
configured to use the same channel.

The unit "samples" count the number of samples from the start of the
WAV file.  On sample includes the values of all channels, eg: for a
stereo WAV file at 44.1 kHz, 1 second is equivalent to 441000 samples.

Objects in GrandOrgue are eg. manuals, stops, generals, ... . Each
object can consist of backend part representing the object an its
configuration (eg. list of sample file names) and multiple GUI
representations.
      </para>
      <para>
The main section is called <emphasis>Organ</emphasis>. It defines the
main panel too. Objects like stops only displayed on a non-main panel
need an invisible definition for the backend part on the main panel
too.

      <para>
The samples are stored as WAV files according to the WAV file
specification. The supported formats are: 8 bit, 16 bit and 24 bit PCM
or 32 bit IEEE float, either mono or stereo. The prefered sample rates
are 44100 or 48000 Hz - GO supports any sample rate between 22000 and
96000 Hz. GO only supports a single data chunk. To play looped
samples, they must include cue points (cue chunk) and loops (smpl
chunk). If there are multiple loops, each loop should overlap another
loop. Attack samples include the attack phase and the loops - they may
contain a release too. If release samples include a cue point, the
release is loaded starting with this position, else the whole file
loaded. dwMIDIUnityNote and dwMIDIPitchFraction of the smpl chunk are
used for retuning an organ to other temperaments.

If multiple sample files are specified for one pipe, they must match
each other in regards to pitch, amplitude and other things. GrandOrgue
only allows adjustments at pipe level.
      </para>
      <para>
The samples in the format above may also be packed with wavpack
http://www.wavpack.com/.  GO only supports the wavpack V4 format
without hybrid compression and it must include all meta data. A good
starting point for the wavpack compression options is

      <para>
An enclosure represents a swell pedal. It consists of non-gui
attributes describing its function.  It it is displayed, it contains
additional gui attributes. Best practise is to specify enclosures in
natural layout order (leftmost first) and give them incremental values
of MIDIInputNumber to make initial configurations easy for the user.

(integer 0 - 200, default: 0) This number is used while building the
initial MIDI configuration to map the enclosure object to one MIDI 
device the user can specify for respective enclosure. A value of 0 
means no association, 1 means enclosure 1, 2 is enclosure 2 etc. 
Please note, the the GUI only allows the association of the first few 
enclosures.

A manual is associated with a number of stops, tremulants, divisionals 
and coupler. The accessible range can be played via MIDI, the rest of 
the logical keys can only be triggered by (octave) coupler. Best practise 
is to specify the visible manuals in the order of appearance, lowest go 
first. Invisible manuals and those used for special effects should be 
specified after the visible ones. Manual objects contains the following

Please note, that the GUI only allows the association of the first few manuals.
Second touch manuals can be set to the same number as the main manual as the
user then only has to configure the low velocity to make it work.

This method should be considered as legacy and used only for backward
compatibility with Hauptwerk&#8482; version 1 samplesets.  The preferred method
for designing a short octave keyboard is through a key mapping (see <link
linkend="midikeyentry">MIDIKey999</link>) and below.

        <simpara><emphasis>MIDI setting: 9x Note short octave at low key</emphasis></simpara>
        <simpara>
Use this setting to simulate a short octave keyboard when the Organ Definition
File only provides a full compass keyboard. GrandOrgue renders sound as if the
keyboard were fit with a short octave, but the visual feedback is that of a
full compass keyboard (e.g. press low E and the keyboard image in the GUI
displays a depressed low C).

When sampling a real-world organ, missing samples in the low octave need to be
generated to get a complete low octave. If this is not done, holes will appear
in the low octave if the keyboard is converted to full compass using the
<link linkend="9xnoteWOmap">9x Note without map</link> MIDI setting.
