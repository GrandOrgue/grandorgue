GrandOrgue allows the user to load and play virtual pipe organs.
Using sample sets, GrandOrgue is able to combine the individual pipe
sounds and organ behaviors to simulate a variety of pipe organs.

      <para>
GrandOrgue is capable of loading and faithfully reproducing a variety
of sample sets. The sample set format is described later in this
manual. The format is backward compatible to Hauptwerk&#8482; version
1 samplesets. As such, you won't be able to do anything at all with
GrandOrgue without at least one sample set. Sample sets generally come
packaged or with installers. By default, the software loads organs
from "My Organs" in your documents folder, but you may store sample
sets wherever is convenient and space permits.

Please look at https://sourceforge.net/p/ourorgan/samplesets/ for
more information.

The effect of the panic menu item is to reset the sound, stopping all
sound and turning off all notes. It may also be quickly accessed on
the toolbar or via the <emphasis>Escape</emphasis> key on the computer keyboard. This should be generally
unnecessary, although it may be useful if you need to quickly stop the
sound output, or if the sound is breaking up due to CPU overload.

          <para>Enters memory set mode until the <emphasis role="bold">Memory Set</emphasis> menu option or toolbar
button is selected again. While the memory set is engaged, whenever
you push a divisional or general piston or activate a program change,
the organ will store the current settings to that piston or program
change rather than recalling them. For example, engaging a divisional
piston 1 during memory set will store the state of stops for that
manual into piston 1, which could then be pushed later (after memory
set has been disengaged) to recall those stops. A checkmark appears
next to the menu item, and the toolbar button remains pushed, to
indicate when memory set is active.

The spinner sets the current program number. This might be termed a
"sequencer" on modern computerized organs. It is possible to store up
to 1000 organ states and access them sequentially via the predefined
MIDI events, or access any setting directly through the spinner. You
may also use the left and right keys on the computer keyboard to scroll through
the programs, and down to reactivate the current program (if you have
changed the stops since last activating it, for example). Note also
that when memory set is engaged, the target program will be stored to,
i.e. if you push Shift + Right then the program would be advanced and
the current settings would be saved to this same next program.

        <para>The polyphony control sets the maximum polyphony before GrandOrgue
will refuse to play any additional samples. To oversimplify, polyphony
is the number of pipes that may sound simultaneously; but polyphony
may also be consumed when a key is released. It is recommended to
experiment with this setting initially, but leave it once you find an
acceptable setting. Your setting should balance between too little
polyphony (where you might not be able to play many notes on large
sample sets) and too much polyphony (where the CPU will overload and
artifacts will appear in the sound). Note that "wet" sample sets
(those with considerable reverberation) will consume polyphony many
seconds after the note is actually released. The default setting of
2048 should provide a reasonable starting point on a 1GHz CPU. The polyphony monitor is displayed next to the spinner. The clip indicator at
the far right will turn red if the polyphony limit has been reached,
and will stay red until the polyphony is adjusted.

This will apply a very small random detuning before each pipe begins to speak.
The detuning is small enough so that the ear can't appreciate the tuning difference and large enough so that it approximates the tiny interferences (due to physical location) that occur when playing multiple real pipes in an organ.

          <para>The assertions about audio quality should be used as guidelines only. As a rule of thumb, polyphase gets better treble, linear gets better bass, and this is most noticeable in sample sets that use interpolation extensively (e.g. retuning a detuned organ).  Audio quality is highly subjective, so the user is strongly encouraged to listen for himself and retain the setting that suits him better.</para>

      <para>This tab shows all available MIDI devices.</para>
      <para>
The upper  frame shows a list of all available MIDI input interfaces. Selecting
a device means that GrandOrgue will listen for incoming MIDI messages through
that interface. This allows to listen to more than one device at a time; for
example, to listen to both a controller and a sequencer or loopback device.
      </para>
      <para>
The lower frame shows a list of all available MIDI output interfaces. Selecting
a device means that GrandOrgue will write MIDI information to external
hardware. Possible uses are SAM or LED drivers for stop control feedback, or
physical pipes drivers when digitally expanding a genuine pipe organ.

This allows the setting of a channel offset. A channel offset allows the use of
two MIDI interfaces with conflicting MIDI channels. For example, applying a
channel offset of 8 to one of the MIDI interfaces would cause that interface's
channel 1 to appear as channel 9, channel 2 to appear as channel 10, and so on.
This may be useful if you have multiple keyboards that are configured to use
the same channel.

      <para>This feature is closely related to the temperament feature which assumes, when the samples are dynamically retuned after a new temperament is applied, that pitch information was embedded in each sample file <emphasis>or in the pipe entry within the Organ Definition File</emphasis>. If the sample set designer has <emphasis role="bold">NOT</emphasis> embedded pitch information, the result is weird and unpredictable.</para>
      <para>When checked, this box instructs GrandOrgue to ignore any pitch information found is sample files while retuning the organ to another temperament than the original.

This screen lists all of the MIDI actions which GrandOrgue can respond
to. The "Action" column describes the action; the "Event" column shows
the MIDI event it is currently tied to; the "Channel" column indicates
which channel the action will listen on, if any; the "Data" column
indicates the specific data which will trigger the action - for
example, a controller number or a program change number. These actions
may be modified by selecting the action and clicking "Properties", or
by double-clicking on the action.

This displays the MIDI event editor dialog. You may select an event
from the drop-down box (only available events will be shown), or you
may select "(none)" to disable the action. The channel spinner sets
the channel tied ot the MIDI message, and the data spinner (when
applicable) selects the data tied to the MIDI message. For easy
configuration, click "Listen for Event" and then perform the desired
MIDI action (i.e. push a note on the appropriate keyboard, do a
program change, flip a MIDI switch, etc). If the performed MIDI event
is allowed for this action, its data is filled in and the "Listen for
Event" button is deactivated. You may also manually deactivate the
listener by clicking on it again. Be sure to select OK to save your
changes when you're done.

A list of all MIDI input interfaces available. Selecting a device
means that GrandOrgue will listen for incoming MIDI messages on

Either select a device and click Advanced, or double click on the
device. This brings up a window that allows the setting of a channel
offset. A channel offset allows the use of two MIDI interfaces with
conflicting MIDI channels. For example, applying a channel offset of 8
to one of the MIDI interfaces would cause that interface's channel 1
to appear as channel 9, channel 2 to appear as channel 10, and so
on. This may be useful if you have multiple keyboards that are
configured to use the same channel.

      <title>Sample format</title>
      <para>
The samples are stored as WAV files according to the WAV file
specification. The supported formats are: 8 bit, 16 bit and 24 bit PCM
or 32 bit IEEE float, either mono or stereo. The prefered sample rates
are 44100 or 48000 Hz - GO supports any sample rate between 22000 and
96000 Hz. GO only supports a single data chunk. To play looped
samples, they must include cue points (cue chunk) and loops (smpl
chunk). If there are multiple loops, each loop should overlap another
loop. Attack samples include the attack phase and the loops - they may
contain a release too. If release samples include a cue point, the
release is loaded starting with this position, else the whole file
loaded. dwMIDIUnityNote and dwMIDIPitchFraction of the smpl chunk are
used for retuning an organ to other temperaments.
      </para>
      <para>
The samples in the format above may also be packed with wavpack
http://www.wavpack.com/.  GO only supports the wavpack V4 format
without hybrid compression and it must include all meta data. A good
starting point for the wavpack compression options is

      <para>
An enclosure represents a swell pedal. It consists of non-gui
attributes describing its function.  It it is displayed, it contains
additional gui attributes. Best practise is to specify enclosures in
natural layout order (leftmost first) and give them incremental values
of MIDIInputNumber to make initial configurations easy for the user.

(integer 0 - 200, default: 0) This number is used while building the
initial MIDI configuration to map the enclosure object to one MIDI 
device the user can specify for respective enclosure. A value of 0 
means no association, 1 means enclosure 1, 2 is enclosure 2 etc. 
Please note, the the GUI only allows the association of the first few 
enclosures.

and coupler. The accessible range can be played via MIDI, the rest of 
the logical keys can only be triggered by (octave) coupler. Best practise 
is to specify the visible manuals in the order of appearance, lowest go 
first. Invisible manuals and those used for special effects should be 
specified after the visible ones. Manual objects contains the following 
non-gui attributes:

(integer 0 - 200, default: 0) This number is used while building the
initial MIDI configuration to map the manual object to what MIDI
device the the user has set for respective pedal/manual. 0 means no 
association. 1 maps to pedal, 2 to first manual, 3 to second manual etc. 
Please note, that the GUI only allows the association of the first few manuals.
Second touch manuals can be set to the same number as the main manual as the
user then only has to configure the low velocity to make it work.

The various GUI manual attributes are specified for the different key
types. They are named: C, Cis, D, Dis, E, F, Fis, G, Gis, A, Ais,
B. If it is the first key on the manual, it is prefixed with First. If
it is the last key on the manual, it is prefixed with Last. So valid
values are eg. Gis, FirstDis, LastAis. In the following, these values
will be marked as <emphasis>KEYTYPE</emphasis>.
