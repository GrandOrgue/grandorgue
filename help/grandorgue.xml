GrandOrgue allows the user to load and play virtual pipe organs.
Using sample sets, GrandOrgue is able to combine the individual pipe
sounds and organ behaviors to simulate a variety of pipe organs.

      <para>
GrandOrgue is capable of loading and faithfully reproducing a variety
of sample sets. The sample set format is described later in this
manual. The format is backward compatible to Hauptwerk&#8482; version
1 sample sets. As such, you won't be able to do anything at all with
GrandOrgue without at least one sample set. Sample sets generally come
packaged or with installers. By default, the software loads organs
from "Organs" in your documents folder, but you may store sample
sets wherever is convenient and space permits.

Please look at https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue/wiki/Sample-Sets for
more information.

      <para>
An organ package is a self-contained archive file that can be opened directly
by GrandOrgue. It does not need to be formally installed on disk. It can
contain more than one sample set.
      </para>
      <para>
The software knows about a dedicated folder (by default: "Organ Packages" in
your documents folder) where organ packages can be dropped. Packages dropped in
that directory are automatically registered by GrandOrgue.
      </para>
      <para>See <link linkend="organ_package_format">The GrandOrgue organ package format</link> for a detailed description of the organ package file format.</para>

piston 1 during memory set will store the state of stops for that
manual into piston 1, which could then be pushed later (after memory
set has been disengaged) to recall those stops. A checkmark appears
next to the menu item, and the toolbar button remains pushed, to

The spinner sets the current program number. This might be termed a
"sequencer" on modern computerized organs. It is possible to store up
to 1000 organ states and access them sequentially via the predefined
MIDI events, or access any setting directly through the spinner. You
may also use the left and right keys on the computer keyboard to scroll through
the programs, and down to reactivate the current program (if you have
changed the stops since last activating it, for example). Note also
that when memory set is engaged, the target program will be stored to,
i.e. if you push Shift + Right then the program would be advanced and
the current settings would be saved to this same next program.

        <para>The polyphony control sets the maximum polyphony before GrandOrgue
will refuse to play any additional samples. To oversimplify, polyphony
is the number of pipes that may sound simultaneously; but polyphony
may also be consumed when a key is released. It is recommended to
experiment with this setting initially, but leave it once you find an
acceptable setting. Your setting should balance between too little
polyphony (where you might not be able to play many notes on large
sample sets) and too much polyphony (where the CPU will overload and
artifacts will appear in the sound). Note that "wet" sample sets
(those with considerable reverberation) will consume polyphony many
seconds after the note is actually released. The default setting of
2048 should provide a reasonable starting point on a 1GHz CPU. The polyphony monitor is displayed next to the spinner. The clip indicator at
the far right will turn red if the polyphony limit has been reached,
and will stay red until the polyphony is adjusted.

This schema describes the close relations that exist between the real-world audio hardware capabilities
and the sample set disposition as provided by the sample set designer.
For illustration, the free sample set of Bureå Church is customized to build a totally different spatial disposition. Here are the assumptions:

this option will fade out the release sample if the note is played
staccato. It will have little to no effect on "dry" sample sets.

This will apply a very small random detuning before each pipe begins to speak.
The detuning is small enough so that the ear can't appreciate the tuning difference and large enough so that it approximates the tiny interferences (due to physical location) that occur when playing multiple real pipes in an organ.

          <para>The assertions about audio quality should be used as guidelines only. As a rule of thumb, polyphase gets better treble, linear gets better bass, and this is most noticeable in sample sets that use interpolation extensively (e.g. retuning a detuned organ). Audio quality is highly subjective, so the user is strongly encouraged to listen for himself and retain the setting that suits him better.</para>

          <para>
If set to Mono, all samples are loaded in Mono. When compression is disabled, this will save 50%, but when compression is enabled, much less will be saved because the compression is much less effective on monaural inputs.

This setting can be set to don't load, if you want GrandOrgue to avoid loading any samples. Via <link linkend="organsettings">Organ Settings</link>, it is still possible to load only specific parts of the organ.

                      You can use the Linux native sound output either via RtAudio as well as via PortAudio. To allow direct hardware access, your Linux user account needs access to the sound card<footnote><simpara>that means being member of the <emphasis>audio</emphasis> group on many Linux distributions</simpara></footnote>.

                      ALSA also provides "virtual" sound card entries. "default" routes the audio to the current default sound card and allows shared access.
                      If the active sample rate on the hardware does not match the GrandOrgue sample rate, ALSA will start resampling, which will increase the CPU usage.

                        Distributions often route the default audio via the PulseAudio daemon. If you don't want to use PulseAudio, you can start GrandOrgue via via pasuspender(1).

                      You can connect to a Jack audio server either via RtAudio as well as PulseAudio. GrandOrgue also includes jack MIDI support, so will likely
                      see MIDI devices twice (via jack as well as via the native OS APIs).

                      GrandOrgue has support for the native audio APIs and jack adds complexity to the sound output stack. Therefore avoid running jack, unless you want to use GrandOrgue together with other jack applications.

This allows the setting of a channel offset. A channel offset allows the use of
two MIDI interfaces with conflicting MIDI channels. For example, applying a
channel offset of 8 to one of the MIDI interfaces would cause that interface's
channel 1 to appear as channel 9, channel 2 to appear as channel 10, and so on.
This may be useful if you have multiple keyboards that are configured to use
the same channel.

          Organs can be registered in multiple ways. When a user opens an .organ
          file first time, the organ is registered. When the user installs an
          organ package (.orgue) file, all organs present in the package are
          registered. Also .orgue packages placed in the packages directory are
          read upon GrandOrgue startup and all their organs are also registered.

      <para>This tab manages settings for an embedded <emphasis role="strong">Convolution Reverberation engine</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>
Convolution reverberation uses the mathematical model of a room response to
alter an audio wave so it sounds as if it had been produced in that room. The
room response is triggered by a bang (starter pistol, balloon pop, hands clap,
...) which is closest to a pulse covering all frequencies. The room response is
made of the volume and decay of sound reflection on walls, floor, ceiling, and
the delay introduced by the room size. The bang record is fed to the
convolution engine to produce the reverberated wave.
      </para>
      <para>The reverberated wave is usually mixed with the direct dry sound to better simulate what the auditor would hear if he were in the physical room.</para>

The reverberated sound, when fed alone to the audio system, usually sounds a

response (delays, multiple echos, etc.). Adding the direct sound is the only
way to get a clear sound, so this box should be checked at all times.

In multi-part polyphony, the BASS coupler tries to enforce the rests found in
the lowest line. This is not 100% safe, so unwanted jumps to the next upper
line may occur. The same applies for the MEL coupler and the highest line.

The metronome settings can be saved in the current settings file and remembered
the next time the sample set is loaded. Use the <link linkend="save">File &gt;
  Save</link> menu item, as there is no warning to save when the sample set is

    <title>The GrandOrgue file format</title>
    <sect1>
      <title>General information</title>
      <para>
It is a text file in ISO-8859-1 encoding. The standard extension is
<emphasis>.organ</emphasis>. As an alternative, the file might be encoded in
UTF-8, if it starts with an appropriate byte order marker.
      </para>
      <para>
        Comments are any text from <emphasis>;</emphasis> to the end of line.
        Empty lines or lines containing only comments are ignored. 
        Thus it's not possible to include <emphasis>;</emphasis> in any string
      </para>
      <para>
Various settings are grouped in blocks. Each block is started with a
line starting with <emphasis>[</emphasis>, followed by the section name and ended with <emphasis>]</emphasis>.
Each block consists of list of name-values pairs separated by <emphasis>=</emphasis>.
Each setting may only occur once. The content is case sensitive.
No other elements are allowed in the file.
      </para>
      <para>
	File paths in this format are relative to the location of the organ
	file. The directory separator in these paths may be
	<emphasis>\</emphasis> or <emphasis>/</emphasis>. The paths should be
	considered case sensitive, even if this is not enforced on all platforms.
      </para>
      <caution>
	<simpara>
	  Hauptwerk only supports <emphasis>\</emphasis> as a directory
	  separator. So use <emphasis>/</emphasis> only if you do not intend
	  the ODF to be HW1-compatible.
	</simpara>
      </caution>
      <para>
Boolean values are represented as <emphasis>Y</emphasis> for "true" and
<emphasis>N</emphasis> for "false".

A color can be one of the following colors (not case sensitive):
BLACK, BLUE, DARK BLUE, GREEN, DARK GREEN, CYAN, DARK CYAN, RED, DARK
RED, MAGENTA, DARK MAGENTA, YELLOW, DARK YELLOW, LIGHT GREY, DARK
GREY, WHITE, BROWN.
Additionally, the HTML syntax #RRGGBB is supported.

A font size can be one of the following values: SMALL, NORMAL, LARGE
or an integer number between 1 and 50.
      </para>
      <para>
A panel size can be one of the following values: SMALL, MEDIUM, MEDIUM LARGE, LARGE
or an integer number between 100 and 32000.

The following image formats are supported: bmp, gif, jpg, ico, png
      </para>
      <para>
A bitmap number is a value between 1 and 64. It refers to a predefined
(wood) background. An odd number and the following even number
represent the same type of wood. The odd number has vertical grain,
while the odd has horizontal grain.
      </para>
      <para>
Floating point numbers use the following format:
<emphasis>-?[0-9]+(.[0-9]*)?</emphasis> That means: a optional minus
sign, followed by at least one digit. The decimal separator is a
period.
      </para>
      <para>
The unit "samples" counts the number of samples from the start of the
WAV file. On sample includes the values of all channels, eg: for a
stereo WAV file at 44.1 kHz, 1 second is equivalent to 44100 samples.

Objects in GrandOrgue are e.g. Manuals, Stops, Generals, ... . Each
object can consist of a backend part representing the object, and its
configuration (eg. list of sample file names) and multiple GUI
representations.
      </para>
      <para>
The main section is called <emphasis>Organ</emphasis>. It defines the
main panel. Objects like stops only displayed on a non-main panel
need an invisible definition for the backend part on the main panel
too.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
      <title>Sample format</title>
      <para>
The samples are stored as WAV files according to the WAV file
specification. The supported formats are: 8 bit, 16 bit and 24 bit PCM
or 32 bit IEEE float, either mono or stereo. The preferred sample rates
are 44100 or 48000 Hz - GO supports any sample rate between 22000 and
96000 Hz. GO only supports a single data chunk. To play looped
samples, they must include cue points (cue chunk) and loops (smpl
chunk). If there are multiple loops, each loop should overlap another
loop. Attack samples include the attack phase and the loops - they may
contain a release too. If release samples include a cue point, the
release is loaded starting with this position, else the whole file is
loaded. dwMIDIUnityNote and dwMIDIPitchFraction of the smpl chunk are
used for retuning an organ to other temperaments.
      </para>
      <para>
If multiple sample files are specified for one pipe, they must match
each other in regards to pitch, amplitude and other things. GrandOrgue
only allows adjustments at pipe level.
      </para>
      <para>
The samples in the format above may also be packed with WavPack
http://www.wavpack.com/. GO supports both the WavPack 4 and WavPack 5 formats,
without hybrid compression and it must include all metadata. A good
starting point for the WavPack compression options is
<emphasis>-x6</emphasis>

An enclosure represents a swell pedal. It consists of non-GUI
attributes describing its function. If it is displayed, it contains
additional GUI attributes. Best practice is to specify enclosures in
natural layout order (leftmost first) and give them incremental values
of MIDIInputNumber to make initial configurations easy for the user.

      <para>
A manual is associated with a number of stops, tremulants, divisionals 
and couplers. The accessible range can be played via MIDI, the rest of
the logical keys can only be triggered by (octave) couplers. Best practice
is to specify the visible manuals in the order of appearance, lowest
first. Invisible manuals and those used for special effects should be 
specified after the visible ones. Manual objects contain the following
non-GUI attributes:

initial MIDI configuration to map the manual object to what MIDI
device the the user has set for the respective pedal/manual. 0 means no
association. 1 maps to pedal, 2 to first manual, 3 to second manual etc. 
NOTE: the GUI only allows the association of the first few manuals.
Second touch manuals can be set to the same number as the main manual as the
user then only has to configure the low velocity to make it work.

      <para>
An organ package is a ZIP file using only the
<emphasis>STORED</emphasis> compression [= compression level 0] with
the extension <emphasis>orgue</emphasis>. It may use the ZIP64
extensions - no other extensions are allowed. It is possible to store
file names containing directories.
      </para>
      <para>
The ID of an organ package is its SHA1 sum with all letter converted
to upper case.
      </para>
      <para>
Each organ package must contain an index file named
<emphasis>organindex.ini</emphasis>. This file lists all contained
organs as well as any other organ package they might depend on.
      </para>
      <para>
Referenced files are only loaded from the organ package - not from the
file system. If a file is missing in the main organ package, it will
search <emphasis>Dependency001</emphasis>, then
<emphasis>Dependency002</emphasis> and so on.

This method should be considered as legacy and used only for backward
compatibility with Hauptwerk&#8482; version 1 sample sets. The preferred method
for designing a short octave keyboard is through a key mapping (see <link
linkend="midikeyentry">MIDIKey999</link>) and below.

        <simpara><emphasis>MIDI setting: 9x Note short octave at low key</emphasis></simpara>
        <simpara>
Use this setting to simulate a short octave keyboard when the Organ Definition
File only provides a full compass keyboard. GrandOrgue renders sound as if the
keyboard were fitted with a short octave, but the visual feedback is that of a
full compass keyboard (e.g. press low E and the keyboard image in the GUI
displays a depressed low C).

When sampling a real-world organ, missing samples in the low octave need to be
generated to get a complete low octave. If this is not done, holes will appear
in the low octave if the keyboard is converted to full compass using the
<link linkend="N9xnoteWOmap">9x Note without map</link> MIDI setting.
