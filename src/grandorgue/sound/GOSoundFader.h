/**
 * This class is responsible for smoothly changing a volume of samples.
 *
 * There are different types of volumes
 * - Target volume. It is defined by total capacity of the sample size and may
 *   be adjusted in odf and settings.
 * - External volume. It may be changed by an enclosure during playback.
 * - VelocityVolume. It is defined when a key is pressed and may be changed if
 *   another coupled key with the same pipe is pressed with another velocity.
 *   It is considered as part of an
 * - Total volume. It is a production of of all volumes above.
 *
 * There are three stages of playing one sample related to the target volume:
 * - Increasing: from 0 to m_TargetVolume during m_IncreasingFrames. It is used
 *   only for crossfade between two samples.
 * - Constant playing: the volume is not changed. Usually it is used for the
 *   attack sample (because the increasing is already sampled).
 * - Decreasing: from m_Ð¡urrentVolume to 0. It is used for both the crossfade
 *   from a loop to a release sample and when playing the release sample when
 *   ReleseTail limitation is used
 *
 * totalVol = targetVolume * externalVolume
 * This volume is applied in the Process() call
